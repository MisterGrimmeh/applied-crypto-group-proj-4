    "\n",
    "Hash collisions are a mathematical inevitability due to the pigeonhole principle, which states that if you map *items* into *containers*, where the number of items exceeds the number of containers, at least one container must hold more than one item. Here, the *items* are inputs into the hash function, and the *containers* are the hashes outputted by the hash functions. Therefore, there must be two inputs that result in the same hashes, given a sufficiently large input set and a sufficiently small output set. This is then exaggerated by the birthday paradox that implies that the probability of collisions increases exponentially and dictates the probability of collisions given the input space."
